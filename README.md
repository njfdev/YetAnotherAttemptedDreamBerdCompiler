# Yet Another Attempted DreamBerd Compiler (YAADBC)

Welcome to Yet Another Attempted DreamBerd Compiler. Even though it is inferior to DreamBerd, this compiler is written in Rust because why not?

> NOTE: Originally I thought it would be cool to do a compiler, but DreamBerd is too cool to be compiled (and I realized it would be much more painful), so it will be interpreted. However, I don't want to change the name of the repo, so it will forever be "Yet Another Attempted DreamBerd Compiler." (Maybe I'll make a compiler in the future)
